Problem Statement:
Predict the amount of insurance claim for Allstate customers.

Questions:
1) What are the factors to include for determining the amount of insurance claim?
2) What are the techniques to be followed for predicting the insurance claim amount?

Approach:
Followed the below framework,

Business understanding:

1) Allstate is a multi billion dollar insurance company. Its goal is to reduce the time or mental energy spent for pushing paper with 
the insurance agent
2) Allstate is creating automated methods of predctng incurance claim costs

Data understanding

1) The dataset consists of 188,319 instances, each corresponding to a claim from a customer
2) The data includes both categorical and numerical variables. It has 116 categorical variables and 14 continuous variables. The 
target variable is the claim amount

Data Preperation:

1) Factorization
All the categorical variables were factorized using the built in function in Python pandas library.

Modelling:
Have implemented Linear regression model to predict the target

Evaluation:
1) I have used Split validation of 75 and 25 ratio for train and validation datasets
2) Have used the metric Mean Square Error (MSE) to evaluate the difference of Actual and predicted number of shares

The baseline model was the mean of the claims amount in the training data set.

Learnings:
1) Leverage python for predictive analytics use cases
2) Factorization of categorical data into numerical data
3) Usage of Mean Absolute error for evaluation
